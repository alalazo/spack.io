Jiawei Zhuang of Harvard University has written a [guide for orchestrating a cloud-HPC cluster](https://jiaweizhuang.github.io/blog/aws-hpc-guide/) using examples of Amazon Web Services ParallelCluster, Slurm, and Spack. The guide provides an easy-to-follow workflow for building and deploying an HPC cluster environment on AWS using the Weather Research and Forecasting model as a real-world example application.

Zhuang and the GEOS-Chem team at Harvard made a reproducible cloud simulation using Spack. Check out their [paper](https://eartharxiv.org/g9etd/), "Enabling high-performance cloud computing for Earth science modeling on over a thousand cores: application to the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry model," which describes using Spack to build caches for reproducible HPC in a cloud cluster.
